[#](#Overview-of-pre-study) Overview of pre-study
=================

Since the cohort 3, we have received a lot of inquiries like "I have no prior knowledge, but love to learn, can I join the ysyx program". Without a doubt, we are very happy to welcome students who love learning so much. But we also need to respect the rules of learning: those who have no basic knowledge should spend more time to build up a good foundation before entering the formal learning stage. That's why ysyx has set up a pre-study phase, so that you can check whether you have acquired enough knowledge to enter the formal learning phase.

The pre-study phase consists of the following elements.

1. log your study everyday, refer to [Study log Sheet (Template)](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DT2RPaWFzVGlzaG1T), which is necessary for subsequent tape out.
2. Read two articles on how to ask questions, and write an essay of no less than 800 words after reading them.
3. complete the installation of Linux (PA0).
4. set up the verilator simulation environment, note the use of specific versions.
5. complete the installation of the Linux system and the mandatory exercises of the basic section.
6. complete the required digital circuits exercises.
7. complete the required C language exercises
8. complete all the contents of the PA1

Once you have completed the above, you can apply for the ysyx defense, and if you pass the defense, you will be admitted to the official ysyx stage. Please follow the instructions in the handout.

#### Handout syntax description

There are some information boxes in the handouts, the color and the icon in the upper left corner will tell you the type of information. For example, this box is for tips. Other categories include

#### Tips related to the progress of the experiment

#### Expanded Reading

#### Optional question for reflection

#### Optional programming question

#### Mandatory contents of the experiment

#### Must-read information related to the progress of the experiment

#### Principles and Methods of Importance Beyond Experimentation

#### Notes on study logs

Please make a copy to your account and turn on the "viewable" permission

The template for the lab report can be customized to include:

* Problems encountered and thoughts
* Any other thoughts you have, e.g., tips, thanks to those who helped you, etc.
* If you have pasted code and posted images, please include a detailed explanation.

#### There's no need to panic.

We don't set up the admission defense in order to filter out the best students and eliminate those with no knowledge; on the contrary, we want you to be prepared to enter the official phase of the course: you will probably find a tidal wave of unfamiliar knowledge at the beginning of the official phase of the course. How you survive the difficulties you will encounter in the future is of paramount importance, but we will give you the secret of survival in the pre-study phase.

#### Pre-study guides (teaching assistants are involved to provide guidance and communication)
