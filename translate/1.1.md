The ultimate goal of PA is to gain a deeper understanding of how programs work on computers by building a simple and complete computer system. Unlike programming assignments that "recursively implement Hannover Towers", computer systems are much more complex than Hannover Towers. This means that training through programming assignments is not enough to complete PA, and that the only way to complete PA is to try to understand and master every detail of the computer system, step by step.

So don't complain about the lack of clarity in the PA handouts in the style of a programming assignment. The reason why the handouts are so brief is to force you to make sense of every detail of the computer system and the relationships between the modules, and to build up enough understanding of the system to face the unknown bugs.

This may be an unprecedented way for you to train, so you need to take on a new challenge with a new attitude.

#### The right way to do PA - start today, don't be lazy (this is a bowl of chicken soup, when you feel lost in the future, come back here to read it)

Let's list some mistakes.

* If you have a problem, try to fix it blindly, maybe it will pass.
* If you can't pass the test with blindly trying to fix it, crying for an TA to fix the problem for you.
* Don't want to spend time and effort following [How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way/blob/master/README-zh_CN.md) and [Stop-Ask-Questions-The-Stupid-Ways](https://github.com/tangx/Stop-Ask-Questions-The-Stupid-Ways/blob/master/README.md).
* This function/file/command is not understandable, anyway, I didn't write it, forget about it
* I'd rather waste my life comfortably in Baidu than use Google to solve a problem quickly.
* The blue box questions don't count, it's okay if you don't read them.
* Anyway, there is a month for the big stage, start doing it in the last week, you should still be able to catch up.

If you adopt the above approach, you may be able to complete the pre-experimentation content really quickly, but this is at the cost of giving up training opportunities. As the experiment progresses, you will feel that PA is becoming more and more of a challenge for you.

The right thing to do is.

* Think more about why
    * It's also good to start with a problem to understand the system
* Solve problems independently.
    * Even if it's to fix a stupid bug, you'll learn more than you think.
    * In other words, if you choose to rely others, you're missing out on more opportunities than you realize *
* Try to understand every detail
    * when it comes to bug fixing, those details are a powerful tool in your hand
    * In other words, when you feel at a loss when tweaking a bug, it's because you don't understand the details
* Doing things with the right tools
    * That's the science of saving time, not being lazy
* Read the handouts. There are a lot of  easter eggs.
    * There are a lot of out-of-place hints in the handouts, and some of them take more than one reading to understand.
    * One more question in the blue box may save you a few days of bug fixing.
*  Finish on time, don't procrastinate
    * So that you have time to do all of the above

In fact, these practices are the most essential training in PA, and such training has already started in PA0: the reason why PA0 let people install the machine from scratch is to let them gain experience in solving small problems, which can be used to solve bigger problems; at the same time, it also spreads the original belief that "I can solve problems independently by STFW and RTFM", and this belief can help people dispel the fear of the unknown.

The mentality you use to cope with your programming assignments will not work here at PA, and problems will be exposed much faster than you think. So, starting today, don't be lazy.

### [#](#what-is-nemu) What is NEMU?

PA aims to implement NEMU, a simplified system-wide emulator. But what is an emulator?

When you were a kid, you probably played NES, Super Mario, Tanks, Contra... Do you still remember their graphics? (I hope there's no generation gap between us...) With the development of time, you can hardly find NES machines in the market. While you are feeling frustrated, the emergence of emulators has awakened your childhood memories. NES Emulator can simulate all the NES game for you. With it, it's like you have a real NES, and you can play your favorite NES games. We ported a [NES emulator project FCEUX](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/fceux-am), which you have cloned in PA0. It's amazing that you can relive your childhood days again in this emulator in the post NES days!

#### Aren't you going to play?

We have provided ROMs of some games for testing at [here](http://jyywiki.cn/ICS/2021/labs/PA1) (may need to be accessed from within the campus network), read and follow `fceux-am/README.md` to run Super Mario in a pop-up

You can also put in other ROM files that you have obtained from STFW, so that you can run other games.

#### Check the screen, buttons and sound

While running the game, you need to check that you can see the screen, respond to button presses and hear the sound. Super Mario doesn't play sound in the initial screen, but it will play sound when you enter a level. If there is no sound, it will affect the optional part of the PA, but will not affect the grade; however, if the screen does not display properly, it may affect the mandatory part of the PA, so please search for a solution yourself.

cIn order to check the buttons, you need to clone a new sub-project `am-kernels`, which contains some test programs:

    cd ics2022
    bash init.sh am-kernels
    

Then run one of the button test programs.

    cd am-kernels/tests/am-tests
    make ARCH=native mainargs=k run
    

After running the program, a new window will pop up, press a key in the new window, you will see the program output the corresponding key information in the terminal, including the key name, keyboard code, and key status. If you find that the output key information does not match the key pressed, please search for a solution by yourself (using keywords like "SDL keystroke", etc.). Some users suggest that the problem may be related to [Chinese input method compatibility problem](https://github.com/NJU-ProjectN/fceux-am/issues/1), for reference.

#### I think the compilation is a bit slow?

The `make` program uses a single thread to compile all files sequentially by default, and with FCEUX's large number of source files, you may have to wait up to ten seconds for the compilation to complete. But nowadays CPUs are multi-core and multi-threaded, so it's a waste of computing power not to use it. To speed up the compilation process, we can have `make` create multiple threads to compile the files in parallel.

To do this, first you need to query how many CPUs are on your system with the `lscpu` command. Then run `make` with  `-j?` parameter, where `? ` is the number of CPUs you queried. For example, `-j4` means to create 4 threads to compile in parallel, if the number of CPUs in the system is greater than or equal to 4, then the operating system can schedule these 4 threads to execute on 4 CPUs at the same time to achieve the acceleration effect; however, if there are only 2 CPUs in the system, then the operating system can at most schedule 2 threads to execute on 2 CPUs at the same time, and the acceleration effect is similar to that of `-j2`. 

To see how the compilation speedup affects you, you can add the `time` command to the front of the compilation command, which will count the execution time of the commands that follow it, so all you need to do is look at the `total` column. You can clear all the results with `make clean`, then recompile and count the times, comparing single-threaded compilation to multi-threaded compilation; you can also try compiling with a different number of threads and compare the speedups.

#### Still too slow?

After we clear all the compilation results and recompile, the source files have not changed at all, so it is reasonable that the compiled target files should be exactly the same as the last compilation results. In that case, can we save the target files in some way, so that the next time we compile, if we find that the source files have not changed, we can just take out the target files as the result of the compilation, thus skipping the compilation step?

There really is a tool to do this! It's called `ccache`.

    apt-get install ccache
    

If you read the `ccache` manual through `man`, you will see that `ccache` is a `compiler cache`. `ccache` is a term used in the computer field, and you will learn about it in a subsequent ICS course.

In order to use `ccache`, you need to do some configuration work. First, run the following command to see where a command is located.

    which gcc
    

By default, it outputs `/usr/bin/gcc`, which means that when you run `gcc`, you are actually running `/usr/bin/gcc`. As an exercise in RTFM, you need to read the contents of `man ccache` and set an environment variable in the `.bashrc` file according to the manual. If you set it correctly and it takes effect, re-run `which gcc`, and you will see that the output becomes `/usr/lib/ccache/gcc`. If you don't know about environment variables and `.bashrc`, STFW.

Now it's time to experience the effects of `ccache`. First `make clean` to clear the result, then recompile and count the time. You'll notice that this time it takes a bit longer than before, because `ccache` takes the time to save the target file in addition to doing the normal compilation work. If you clear the results again, recompile and count the times, you will see that the second compilation is much faster! This means that `ccache` is indeed speeding up the process by skipping a completely repetitive compilation. If used in conjunction with multi-threaded compilation, the compilation can be accelerated even further!

In the process of developing a project, sometimes you do need to do a fresh build after `make clean` the compilation results. In the later stages of a PA, you may be compiling libraries containing hundreds of files several times, and in these cases, `ccache` can save you a lot of compilation time, thus improving the efficiency of your project.

You are overwhelmed by the power of computers, and you wonder, how does this happen? You've taken a basic programming course, but you still can't find the answer you're looking for. But you're sure that the NES emulator is just an ordinary program, because you still need to run it like a Hello World program. But at the same time, you think, NES emulator is not like a normal program, how does it emulate the world of NES, so that NES games can run in this world?

In fact, NEMU does something similar! It simulates a hardware world in which you can execute programs. In other words, you'll be writing a program that executes other programs in PA! In order to better understand the functionality of NEMU, here are some of the things you can do with it

* Run Hello World programs in GNU/Linux.
* Play Super Mario in GNU/Linux through the NES emulator.
* Run the Hello World program through NEMU in GNU/Linux.

Compare these three scenarios.

                             +---------------------+  +---------------------+
                             |     Super Mario     |  |    "Hello World"    |
                             +---------------------+  +---------------------+
                             |    Simulated NES    |  |      Simulated      |
                             |       hardware      |  |       hardware      |
    +---------------------+  +---------------------+  +---------------------+
    |    "Hello World"    |  |     NES Emulator    |  |        NEMU         |
    +---------------------+  +---------------------+  +---------------------+
    |      GNU/Linux      |  |      GNU/Linux      |  |      GNU/Linux      |
    +---------------------+  +---------------------+  +---------------------+
    |    Real hardware    |  |    Real hardware    |  |    Real hardware    |
    +---------------------+  +---------------------+  +---------------------+
              (a)                      (b)                     (c)
    

Figure (a) illustrates the "Hello World in GNU/Linux" scenario. The GNU/Linux operating system runs directly on real computer hardware, abstracts the underlying computer hardware, and provides interfaces and services to the higher-level user programs. When the Hello World program outputs information, it needs to use the interface provided by the operating system, so the Hello World program does not run directly on the real computer hardware, but on the operating system (in this case, GNU/Linux).

Figure (b) shows "playing Super Mario on NES emulator in GNU/Linux". To GNU/Linux, the NES Emulator running on it is nothing more than a user program, just like the Hello World program mentioned above. The amazing thing is that the NES Emulator is responsible for simulating a complete set of NES hardware on which Super Mario can run. The fact that Super Mario can't tell whether it's running on real NES hardware or simulated NES hardware is a blindfold for the "emulator".

Figure (c) illustrates "Hello World in GNU/Linux via NEMU". To GNU/Linux, the NEMU running on it is just a user program like the Hello World program mentioned above. However, NEMU is responsible for emulating a set of computer hardware on which programs can run. In fact, the above figure only gives a basic understanding of NEMU, more details will be added in the following PA.

#### What is NEMU?

The above description may seem a bit obscure to you, so let's look at an example of an ATM machine.

An ATM is a physically existing machine, and its function is supported by physical circuitry and mechanical modules. For example, when we make a deposit at an ATM machine, the ATM machine will make a loud noise to make us believe that it is a real machine. On the other hand, third-party payment platforms are also very popular nowadays, such as Alipay. In fact, we can consider Alipay App as a simulated ATM machine, in which all the functions of a real ATM machine, including depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, transferring, etc., are implemented by the Alipay App program.

Similarly, NEMU is a simulated computer system, the basic functions of a physical computer are implemented in NEMU through the program. To simulate a computer system is not as difficult as you think. We can think of a computer as consisting of a number of hardware components that help each other to "run the program". In NEMU, each hardware component is modeled by a program-related data object, such as a variable, an array, a structure, etc.; and operations on these components are modeled by operations on the corresponding data objects. For example, NEMU uses an array to simulate memory, so reading or writing to this array is equivalent to reading or writing to memory.

We can think of the process of implementing NEMU as developing an Alipay app. The difference is that Alipay has the functionality of a real ATM, which is used for transactions, while NEMU has the functionality of a physical computer system, which is used to execute programs. Therefore, we say that NEMU is a program that executes other programs.

The power of NEMU will surprise you! Not only can it run small programs like Hello World, but later in PA, you'll be able to run the classic RPG [Chinese Paladin](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%BB%99%E5%89%91%E5%A5%87%E4%BE%A0%E4%BC%A0/5129500#viewPageContent)(cool! %>\_<%). If you complete all the optional programming content, you can even run the modern text adventure game [CLANNAD](https://baike.baidu.com/item/CLANNAD/25452) in NEMU! After completing PA, your knowledge of programming in your programming class will be turned upside down, you will feel that computers are no longer a mysterious black box, and you may even find that creating your own computer is no longer out of reach!

### [#](#选择你的角色) 选择你的角色

#### 新特性 - 多主线

PA有一个多主线的特性. 具体地, 你需要从[x86open in new window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86)/[mips32open in new window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture)/[riscv32(64)open in new window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V)这三种[指令集架构(ISA)open in new window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture)中选择一种, 来实现"创造属于自己的计算机"这一梦想.

但无论选择哪种ISA, 你最终都会体会到"软硬件共同协助来支持程序执行"的机理: 所谓的tradeoff, 只不过是决定将一件事情交给硬件来做, 还是交给软件来做. 但三种ISA毕竟各有特色, 它们对不同章节的攻略难度如下表所示(5星 - 容易, 1星 - 困难)

x86

mips32

riscv32(64)

PA1 - 简易调试器

与ISA选择关系不大

PA2 - 冯诺依曼计算机系统

PA3 - 批处理系统

PA4 - 分时多任务

#### 什么是ISA?

大部分课本上都会有类似"ISA是软件和硬件之间的接口"这种诠释, 但对于还不了解软件和硬件之间如何协同工作的你来说, "接口"这个词还是太抽象了.

为了理解ISA, 我们可以用现实生活中的例子来比喻: 螺钉和螺母是生活中两种常见的物品, 它们一般需要配对来使用. 给定一个螺钉, 那就要找到一个符合相同尺寸规范的螺母才能配合使用, 反之亦然.

在计算机世界中也是类似的: 不同架构的计算机(或者说硬件)好比不同尺寸的螺钉, 不同架构的程序(或者说软件)就相当于是不同尺寸的螺母, 如果一个程序要在特定架构的计算机上运行, 那么这个程序和计算机就必须是符合同一套规范才行.

因此, ISA的本质就是类似这样的规范. 所以ISA的存在形式既不是硬件电路, 也不是软件代码, 而是一本规范手册.

和螺钉螺母的生产过程类似, 计算机硬件是按照ISA规范手册构造出来的, 而程序也是按照ISA规范手册编写(或生成)出来的, 至于ISA规范里面都有哪些内容, 我们应该如何构造一个符合规范的计算机, 程序应该如何遵守这些规范来在计算机上运行, 回答这些问题正是做PA的一个目标.

#### 我该如何选择?

如果你打算选熟悉的, 那就选x86, 毕竟ICS理论课主要围绕x86开展. 但你多半会被x86指令的复杂性折磨半死, 而且x86的最终性能其实并不高, 不能流畅地展示游戏的运行.

如果你打算选简单的, 那就选riscv32, 你将会体会到什么是"优雅的ISA设计". 由于riscv32的简单, 你可以比较轻松地获得近乎x86两倍的性能, 有着不错的展示效果.

如果你接下来打算设计一款riscv64的硬件处理器, 那就选riscv64, 你将会体会到DiffTest是如何帮你大幅提升硬件开发效率, 告别枯燥的波形调试.

如果你打算挑战极限, 那就选mips32: 相比于以上两者, 选择mips32需要了解更多细节才能正确构建出完整的计算机系统. 因此mips32仅供喜欢挑战, 或者攻略二周目的同学选择.

不过无论你选哪种ISA, 有一点是共通的, 那就是RTFM, 因为ISA的本质是规范手册. 另外, NEMU程序本身也是x86的(准确来说是x64), 不会随着你选择的ISA而变化, 变化的只是在NEMU中模拟的计算机.

#### 如果你是修读本课程(计算机系统基础)的学生, 那么你就没有选择了

你必须选择riscv32, 否则你的代码提交到OJ上将会无法正确运行. 我们之所以这样要求大家, 是因为

*   riscv是模块化的, 选择riscv32只需要实现很少的指令
*   大家已经在大一下学期的"数字逻辑与计算机组成"课程中学习过riscv32, 相比于其它ISA, 大家对riscv32会更加熟悉
*   框架代码的基础设施对riscv有更好的支持

这些原因都可以帮助你更顺利地完成PA, 从而投入更多的时间到期末复习当中.

为了方便叙述, 讲义将用`$ISA`来表示你选择的ISA, 例如对于`nemu/src/isa/$ISA/reg.c`, 若你选择的是x86, 它将表示`nemu/src/isa/x86/reg.c`; 若你选择的是riscv32, 它将表示`nemu/src/isa/riscv32/reg.c`. 除非讲义明确说明, 否则`$ISA`总是表示你选择的ISA, 而不是`$ISA`这四个字符.

NEMU的框架代码会把riscv32作为默认的ISA, 如果你希望选择其它ISA, 你需要在NEMU的工程目录下执行`make menuconfig`, 然后在`Base ISA`一栏中切换到你选择的ISA, 然后保存配置并退出菜单.

最后, 你还需要领取新手礼包 - ISA相关的生存手册 (部分ISA无关的手册请到[讲义首页](/docs/ics-pa/index.html#%E5%AE%98%E6%96%B9%E6%89%8B%E5%86%8C)领取):

#### riscv32和riscv64

事实上, riscv32和riscv64之间的区别非常小, 以至于它们的ISA手册都是相同的. 因此讲义中绝大部分针对riscv32的描述, 对riscv64也是适用的. 在描述不适用riscv64的场合, 我们会进行额外的补充说明. 因此如果你选择了riscv64, 当讲义中没有对riscv64进行额外说明的时候, 你只需要参考riscv32的相应说明即可.

### [#](#还等什么呢) 还等什么呢?

让我们来开始这段激动人心的旅程吧!

#### 做一个素质合格的CSer

PA除了给大家展示"程序如何在计算机中执行"这一终极目标之外, 还加入了很多科学的做事原则. PA在尝试制造场景让大家体会这些原则的重要性, 这也是作为一个素质合格的CSer的必修课. 如果你只是仅仅把PA作为一个编程大任务, 我们相信你确实吃了亏.

PA是一个值得打二周目的游戏, 在二周目的过程中, 你会对这些原则有更深刻的理解. 多主线的特性也让二周目不至于太过乏味, 同时讲义中也准备了一些适合在二周目思考的问题, 希望大家玩得开心!

#### 随时记录实验心得

我们已经在你学长学姐的实验报告中多次看到类似的悔恨: 因为没有及时记录实验心得而在编写实验报告的时候忘记了自己经历趣事的细节. 为了和助教们分享你的各种实验经历, 我们建议你在实验过程中随时记录实验心得, 比如自己踩过的大坑, 或者是调了一周之后才发现的一个弱智bug, 等等.

我们相信, 当你做完PA回过头来阅读这些心得的时候, 就会发现这对你来说是一笔宝贵的财富.
