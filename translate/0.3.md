[#](#Reviewing-the-C-language) Reviewing the C language
=================

C is the language of choice for developing system software, and considering that many of the students participating in ysyx project majored in non-computer science, the learning curve for C is relatively simple. You need to know the following: recursion, pointers, linked lists, and be able to write a correct program on your own (not by searching for a so-called sample code on Google).

#### Some recommended materials for learning C

*   [The C programming language (2nd Edition)](http://cslabcms.nju.edu.cn/problem_solving/images/c/cc/The_C_Programming_Language_%282nd_Edition_Ritchie_Kernighan%29.pdf): By the father of C [Dennis M. Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie)
*   [C Coding Standard](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~eno/coding/CCodingStandard.html)
*   [SEI CERT C Coding Standard](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/SEI+CERT+C+Coding+Standard)
*   [Learn C the hard way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/)
*   [Linux C Programming One-Stop Learning (Chinese)](http://akaedu.github.io/book/)

#### Some simple C++ fundamentals are also required

Verilator compiles Verilog to C++, but you don't need to know complex C++ syntax, you just need to know the basics of how to use a class. From this point of view alone, there are many sources on the web that can fulfill your needs.

#### Essential Questions for Introduction to C

[Learn C the hard way](https://learncodethehardway.org/c/) Exercises 0 through 18, Exercise 32, Exercise 33, Exercise 42, Exercise 44. Require the completion of programming algorithms as well as additional questions.

*   This is part of the admissions defense, so if you get stuck at some point, you can RTFW or consult with a teaching assistant
*   References use the learning materials mentioned above
